## ⚖️ Responsible AI & Accessibility Considerations

### Speech-to-Text in Hiring Interviews - Key Considerations:

#### Bias and Fairness
- Speech recognition accuracy varies across accents, dialects, and speech patterns
- Non-native speakers may experience lower recognition accuracy
- Regional vocabulary and pronunciation differences can affect transcription quality
- System should be regularly tested across diverse speaker demographics

#### Accessibility Requirements
- Provide alternative input methods (text typing) for all speech interfaces
- Support for candidates with speech disabilities or impairments
- Clear visual feedback during speech recognition process
- Adequate time allowances for responses without penalties

#### Privacy and Consent
- Explicit consent required before recording voice data
- Clear data retention and deletion policies
- Transparency about how voice data is processed and stored
- Option to opt-out of voice recording without disadvantage

#### Technical Reliability
- Fallback mechanisms for technical failures
- Internet connectivity requirements clearly communicated
- Testing environment provided before actual interview
- Support for multiple attempts if recognition fails

#### Legal Compliance
- Adherence to disability discrimination laws (ADA, etc.)
- Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Equal opportunity employment requirements
- Documentation of reasonable accommodations provided

#### Quality Assurance
- Human review of transcriptions for critical decisions
- Regular auditing of system performance across demographics
- Continuous monitoring for bias in outcomes
- Feedback mechanism for candidates to report issues

#### Transparency and Communication
- Clear explanation of how speech recognition affects evaluation
- Information about technology limitations upfront
- Guidelines on optimal recording conditions
- Support channels for technical assistance
